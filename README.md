<h3>Creating an Image Slider with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h3>

<p>
Tonight, I wasn't feeling well, so I decided to keep myself busy by writing some code. I stayed up all night and wrote an image slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project not only helped me get through a tough night but also gave me a chance to brush up on my coding skills after a long time. I meticulously explained each line of the JavaScript code to help you understand what it does.

If you're interested in learning how to create an image slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my code will
 guide you through the process step by step. This is a great way to enhance your coding skills. I also recently created an image slider using Swiper.js, which I hope you find useful as well.
